Are the medal winners outliers? Or are all humans collectively getting faster? \n\nBelow I have subdivided the data by gender and race so that I can create some visualizations to track how times have changed since the early 1900s\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Pulling out 100m World Records \n\n_(different than Olympic records because of other track events that can also result in world records)_\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Pulling out 200m World Records \n\n_(different than Olympic records because of other track events that can also result in world records)_\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Men's 100 Meter Medals Over Time\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Women's 100 Meter Medals Over Time\n\n2000 Women's 100M gold: The gold medal was originally won by Marion Jones of the United States. However, on 5 October 2007, she admitted to having used performance-enhancing drugs prior to the 2000 Olympics. On 9 October she relinquished her medals to the United States Olympic Committee, and on 12 December the International Olympic Committee formally stripped her of her medals.\n\nThe IOC did not initially decide to regrade the results, as silver medalist Ekaterini Thanou had herself been subsequently involved in a doping scandal in the run-up to the 2004 Summer Olympics. After two years of deliberation, in late 2009 the IOC decided to upgrade Lawrence (original bronze) and Ottey (original 4th) to silver and bronze respectively, and leave Thanou as a silver medalist, with the gold medal withheld.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Men's 200 Meter Medals Over Time\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Women's 200 Meter Medals Over Time\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
