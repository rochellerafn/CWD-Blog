## How it All Began

Chose to use Square back in 2013 when it was primarily used as a mobile payment option. Why? Because I saw the value in the cloud based data storage


## How it All Started
I eventually used raw data to research and develop my own data frames and metrics.

## How it All Started
With those metrics I created my own data analysis and visualizations.
